# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started my 100 Days by beginning to code a tribute page on Frida Kahlo (I just saw the new Kahlo exhibit at the Dali Museum in St. Petersburg and I absolutely loved it). The tribute page is one of the challenges on FreeCodeCamp.com (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page). Today I created an account on Code Pen and coded the basic HTML for my project. I found some design inspiration online as well as some free images that are licensed through Creative Commons that I can use for my page.

**Thoughts** The first hour of coding really flew by and I actually ended up working over an hour. I am excited to try some new things and get better with Bootstrap with this project.
I have already learned how helpful Code Pen is and how to import Google fonts in (I used these directions https://blog.codepen.io/2012/07/18/custom-fonts-in-pens/).

1. Le col de Claudine http://www.lecoldeclaudine.com/fr (Love the color palette and the flow of the page. How does the background color change as the page scrolls?)
2. This awesome tribute page to Porter Robinson (https://codepen.io/adrianang/pen/GNGrpb?editors=1100)
