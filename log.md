# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started my 100 Days by beginning to code a tribute page on Frida Kahlo (I just saw the new Kahlo exhibit at the Dali Museum in St. Petersburg and I absolutely loved it). The tribute page is one of the challenges on FreeCodeCamp.com (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page). Today I created an account on Code Pen and coded the basic HTML for my project. I found some design inspiration online as well as some free images that are licensed through Creative Commons that I can use for my page.

**Thoughts** The first hour of coding really flew by. I am excited to try some new things and get better with Bootstrap with this project.
