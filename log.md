# 100 Days Of Code - Log


#Day 8: January 10, 2017##
**Today's Progress** After examining my code with my professor, I realized that the white line around my project was an accident -- I had two body elements in my CSS file and one of them had 20px. I deleted that, but the page still wouldn't load. I tried fixing it in Codepen and the top part of the page lost the padding (still not sure what's up with the sides, but it appears only on the header image -- the footer actually looks like a footer now). To solve the problem, I just made a new folder, pasted in my fixed code to a new HTML and CSS file, and then re-uploaded to my website.
I also looked into creating a new portfolio page. I think that will be my next challenge.

#Day 7: January 9, 2017##
**Today's Progress** Yesterday after I uploaded my page to my site I realized that it looked HORRIBLE on mobile. Just awful. The first image looked half-loaded on ipads, iphones and other browsers. Today I sized the image down and that helped. I am so relieved. I also added background-size: cover; to my Css page for the background image of the headline. It doesn't look perfect (seriously, what's the deal with the white border that runs around the whole page? I don't understand.) However, I can live with it for now. Progress is slow but at least I'm making steps in the right direction.

**Thoughts** I'm learning a lot and this is coming along. I had to re-upload the new version on my page but I'm glad I fixed it.

#Day 6: January 8, 2017##
**Today's Progress**: I finished my Frida Kahlo tribute page! I added more photos and changed the style so that the timeline looks better. I learned how to add space between li elements (add margin to the li element in css, NOT ul. Good to know) as well as how to center images in Bootstrap columns.

**Thoughts** This was not as bad as I thought it would be. I coded in the morning and I think it was easier to do it earlier in the day than later. I'm hoping I can make this a habit.
Also, it was really awesome to run the files through an HTML and CSS validator and only have one error (a stray div tag)!
The only thing that's driving me crazy is this white line around the top, side and bottom of the site. I'm going to see if anyone can help me fix that.

It's up on my personal site! Finally.

#Day 5: January 7, 2017##
**Today's Progress**: I took a break from the Tribute page to try some JQuery exercises. I did 10 exercises on FreeCodeCamp and took some notes on what I learned.

**Thoughts** I did about 30 minutes of work and then I had to stop because it was really late. I feel bad because I didn't make the whole hour, but earlier this week I worked for several hours in a row on multiple days, so I feel like it about evens out. I figured that even a little bit is better than nothing, but I'm going to try to do more tomorrow.

##Day 4: January 6, 2017##
**Today's Progress**: I added more to my Frida Kahlo page, including the timeline and other photos.

**Thoughts** It's difficult to find an hour every day to code, especially since classes are starting to pick up again. I'm glad I'm doing this though!

##Day 3: January 5, 2017##
**Today's Progress**: I added CSS to my tribute page. I am very glad that I reviewed Bootstrap because it is way easier to use the grid system to put images and text next to each other than having to deal with floats. I coded for almost two hours, but I am having trouble with this white border around my page. Will try to solve it tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I am really pleased with what this looks like. CodePen.io is helpful, but it would be easier to use it on a bigger laptop. I am still happy with how this piece is going and I'm taking my time making it look nice because I want this to be a portfolio piece (Note-- I want to design a really nice portfolio home page at some point during this challenge)

##Day 2: January 4, 2017##
**Today's Progress**: I want to code my tribute page using Bootstrap so that it looks nice in mobile but I feel very rusty with Bootstrap. I decided to complete some of the Responsive Design With Bootstrap challenges on Free Code Camp. I went through challenges on how to center text, make images responsive, create buttons, align text and images, etc. I also learned how to add Font Awesome images to buttons, which was pretty cool! I made sure to take notes so that I can refer back to everything when I am coding the Tribute Page (and doing future projects!)

**Thoughts** I am very happy that I took a day to practice Bootstrap exercises. I'm still new to coding and I found today to be a helpful refresher, plus I learned a few new things. I love the Bootstrap challenges on Free Code Camp and the way they explain the Bootstrap grid system is very clear. Tomorrow I think I'll try a few more and then actually apply it to my Tribute Page so it looks pretty.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started my 100 Days by beginning to code a tribute page on Frida Kahlo (I just saw the new Kahlo exhibit at the Dali Museum in St. Petersburg and I absolutely loved it). The tribute page is one of the challenges on FreeCodeCamp.com (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page). Today I created an account on Code Pen and coded the basic HTML for my project. I found some design inspiration online as well as some free images that are licensed through Creative Commons that I can use for my page.

**Thoughts** The first hour of coding really flew by and I actually ended up working over an hour. I am excited to try some new things and get better with Bootstrap with this project.
I have already learned how helpful Code Pen is and how to import Google fonts in (I used these directions https://blog.codepen.io/2012/07/18/custom-fonts-in-pens/).
