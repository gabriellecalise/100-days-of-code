# 100 Days Of Code - Log

##Day 4: January 6, 2017##
**Today's Progress**: I added more to my Frida Kahlo page, including the timeline and other photos. 

**Thoughts** It's difficult to find an hour every day to code, especially since classes are starting to pick up again. I'm glad I'm doing this though!

##Day 3: January 5, 2017##
**Today's Progress**: I added CSS to my tribute page. I am very glad that I reviewed Bootstrap because it is way easier to use the grid system to put images and text next to each other than having to deal with floats. I coded for almost two hours, but I am having trouble with this white border around my page. Will try to solve it tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I am really pleased with what this looks like. CodePen.io is helpful, but it would be easier to use it on a bigger laptop. I am still happy with how this piece is going and I'm taking my time making it look nice because I want this to be a portfolio piece (Note-- I want to design a really nice portfolio home page at some point during this challenge)

##Day 2: January 4, 2017##
**Today's Progress**: I want to code my tribute page using Bootstrap so that it looks nice in mobile but I feel very rusty with Bootstrap. I decided to complete some of the Responsive Design With Bootstrap challenges on Free Code Camp. I went through challenges on how to center text, make images responsive, create buttons, align text and images, etc. I also learned how to add Font Awesome images to buttons, which was pretty cool! I made sure to take notes so that I can refer back to everything when I am coding the Tribute Page (and doing future projects!)

**Thoughts** I am very happy that I took a day to practice Bootstrap exercises. I'm still new to coding and I found today to be a helpful refresher, plus I learned a few new things. I love the Bootstrap challenges on Free Code Camp and the way they explain the Bootstrap grid system is very clear. Tomorrow I think I'll try a few more and then actually apply it to my Tribute Page so it looks pretty.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started my 100 Days by beginning to code a tribute page on Frida Kahlo (I just saw the new Kahlo exhibit at the Dali Museum in St. Petersburg and I absolutely loved it). The tribute page is one of the challenges on FreeCodeCamp.com (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page). Today I created an account on Code Pen and coded the basic HTML for my project. I found some design inspiration online as well as some free images that are licensed through Creative Commons that I can use for my page.

**Thoughts** The first hour of coding really flew by and I actually ended up working over an hour. I am excited to try some new things and get better with Bootstrap with this project.
I have already learned how helpful Code Pen is and how to import Google fonts in (I used these directions https://blog.codepen.io/2012/07/18/custom-fonts-in-pens/).
